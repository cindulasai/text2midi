## 💡 Pro Tips

### General Workflow
1. **Start simple** - Generate basic 4-track composition first
2. **Iterate** - Use multiple turns to refine
3. **Listen critically** - Compare versions
4. **Save versions** - Keep multiple exports
5. **Export properly** - Use 44.1kHz, 16-bit WAV for archiving

### Sound Design
1. **Choose instruments matching the feeling** - Genre + mood
2. **Use reverb strategically** - Background elements need it
3. **EQ is your friend** - Each instrument gets unique frequency space
4. **Less is more** - Silence is a musical element
5. **Reference commercially** - Compare your mix to professional tracks

### Prompting Tips
1. **Be specific** - Genre, key, emotion, instruments
2. **Use musical language** - Lyra understands "bright", "dark", "punchy"
3. **Describe the feeling** - Why this music matters
4. **Iterate strategically** - Build complexity gradually
5. **Save great prompts** - Reuse templates you like
